## ü§ñ Core Agents

### 1. **ChatGPT (Codex Mode)**
**Role:** Primary development and integration assistant.

- Maintains project memory and canonical state across sessions.  
- Produces MANIFEST summaries for every deliverable.  
- Operates strictly according to user rules (Repo-First, Stability, Transparency).  
- Supports: Python modules (`core/`, `utils/`, `telegram/`, `reports/`, `scripts/`), CI workflows, and documentation.

**Rules:**  
1. Never alter the project‚Äôs logical flow without confirmation.  
2. Always read the canonical repo (Zaikon13/wallet_monitor_Dex) before editing.  
3. Deliver one file per cycle unless multi-file MANIFEST is explicitly requested.  
4. Use `# TODO:` only for optional or speculative code.  
5. Avoid CLI/Bash suggestions ‚Äî GitHub Web UI only.
